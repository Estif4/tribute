	<h1>Nelson Mandela in 1990</h1>
	<p>In 1990, Nelson Mandela was released from prison after serving 27 years for his anti-apartheid activities. His release marked the beginning of negotiations between the ANC and the National Party government aimed at ending apartheid and establishing a democratic, non-racial South Africa. Mandela played a leading role in these negotiations, which culminated in the country's first democratic elections in 1994, in which he was elected as the first black president of South Africa.</p>
