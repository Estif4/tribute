	<h1>Nelson Mandela in 1994</h1>
	<p>In 1994, Nelson Mandela was inaugurated as the first black president of South Africa, marking the end of apartheid and the beginning of a new era in the country's history. Mandela's presidency was marked by his commitment to reconciliation and nation-building, as he sought to heal the wounds of apartheid and build a more equitable and just society. He stepped down as president in 1999, but his legacy as a champion of human rights and a symbol of hope and inspiration continues to inspire people around the world.</p>
