	<h1>Nelson Mandela in 1955</h1>
	<p>In 1955, Nelson Mandela played a key role in the drafting and adoption of the Freedom Charter, a document that outlined the vision and goals of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. The Charter, which was adopted at a Congress of the People in Kliptown, called for a non-racial, democratic society in which all people would have equal rights and opportunities.</p>
