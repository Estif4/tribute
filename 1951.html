	<h1>Nelson Mandela in 1951</h1>
	<p>In 1951, Nelson Mandela became involved in the Defiance Campaign, a coordinated effort by the African National Congress (ANC) to challenge apartheid laws through nonviolent civil disobedience. The campaign involved protesters deliberately violating apartheid laws, such as entering "whites-only" areas or refusing to carry ID cards, and willingly accepting arrest and imprisonment as a way of exposing the injustice of the system. Mandela served as a volunteer for the campaign, helping to organize protests and demonstrations, and was eventually appointed to the national executive of the ANC.</p>
