	<h1>Nelson Mandela in 1962</h1>
	<p>In 1962, Nelson Mandela was arrested in a police raid on the underground headquarters of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the militant wing of the African National Congress (ANC). He was charged with leaving the country without a passport and inciting workers to strike, and was later charged with sabotage for his involvement in Umkhonto we Sizwe's sabotage campaign against the apartheid government. Mandela was sentenced to five years in prison, and while he was serving this sentence, he was charged with more serious offenses and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964.</p>
