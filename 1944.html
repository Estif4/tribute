	<h1>Nelson Mandela in 1944</h1>
	<p>In 1944, Nelson Mandela was a law student and political activist in Johannesburg, South Africa. Along with other young activists, he helped to found the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in order to push for more radical and militant tactics in the fight against apartheid.</p>
	<p>Under Mandela's leadership, the ANCYL began organizing protests, boycotts, and strikes, and advocating for civil disobedience as a means of challenging the apartheid system. Mandela also became involved in the broader anti-apartheid movement, working with other activists to build alliances across racial and political lines.</p>
	<p>Overall, Mandela's actions in 1944 marked the beginning of his long and storied career as a leader in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, which eventually led to his imprisonment and ultimate release in 1990, as well as his later role as the country's first black president.</p>
