	<h1>Nelson Mandela in 1956</h1>
	<p>In 1956, Nelson Mandela was arrested and charged with treason along with 155 other anti-apartheid activists. The charges were based on their involvement in the drafting and adoption of the Freedom Charter, which the government saw as a threat to the apartheid system. The trial lasted for four years and ended in 1961 with the acquittal of all the accused.</p>
